Sequential Territorial Control

Objective: Capture all five command points in the map in sequential order.
Move onto a capture point to capture.

Scoring: 30 points for capturing all the command points.

Other Notes:
Blue captures points in order -- 1,2,3,4,5.
Red captures points in descending order -- 5,4,3,2,1.

Once a point has been captured, it cannot be re-captured for 15 seconds.
Points have a panel covering them when they cannot be captured.

The tunnel under the bridge requires a detpack to clear.
Once it's been cleared, another detpack explosion can re-seal it.
