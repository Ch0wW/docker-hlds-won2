<h3>Which class should I play?</h3>
</a>

<p>There's no right answer to this question. Everyone likes playing different classes, and
most players have 2 or 3 classes they play regularly. When you're getting bored with a
class, try a new one. The contrast in playing style between classes is one of TF's
strengths. </p>

<p>There's a class for everything, and the trick is to find a class that's good at doing
what you want to do. If you want to play Offense and capture flags, playing a Heavy
Weapons Guy will only make things harder for you.<br>
</p>

<p>Here's a quick rundown of playing styles. Read over them, and pick the one that sounds
the most fun to you: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#Scout">Scout</a> - The perfect
  flag capturer. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Scouts are the best flag capturers, so they are utterly essential in any map which
    involves a flag (maps with objectives like Capture the Flag or Territorial Control).
    Scouts can be effective even without firing a single shot, since their strength lies in
    their speed rather than in their combat skills. If you like moving twice as fast as
    everyone else, and screaming for an escort as you escape the enemy base with the Flag and
    the entire enemy team pursuing you, then the Scout is your class. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#Sniper">Sniper</a> - The
  ultimate long-range fighter. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Sniper is the only class that can kill an enemy on the other side of the map with
    almost no warning at all. Be careful though, for if the enemy engages you at close range
    you're weaker than most of the other classes. If you like settling down into a good sniper
    position and methodically killing every enemy who exits his base with a single shot to the
    head, then the Sniper is for you. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#Soldier">Soldier</a> - The best
  all-around fighter. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The workhorse in any TF team, soldiers perform well at any task and specialize in
    none. If you like killing lots and lots of enemies in straight man-to-man combat, this is
    the class for you. Soldiers are a core class in any offensive or defensive squad. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#Demoman">Demoman</a> - A lethal
  close-range fighter. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Carrying more explosive weaponry than any other class, the Demoman clears whole rooms
    in seconds. He's essential on maps where the use of high explosives can destroy barriers,
    allowing access to more entrances into the enemy base. His remotely-detonable bombs make
    him a vicious defender in enclosed spaces. If you like watching the smoke clear and seeing
    bodies everywhere, the Demoman's your class. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#Medic">Medic</a> - The most
  indirectly lethal class in the game. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A solid close-to-medium range fighter, the Medic moves swiftly and carries a gun that
    enables him to mow down any of the weaker classes without too much trouble. His real
    strength lies in his ability to heal himself and his teammates with his medikit. If you
    love seeing eternal gratitude in the eyes of your teammates, or can't aim at all and still
    want to be incredibly useful to your Team, go for the Medic class. You might not kill a
    lot of enemies, but the teammates whose lives you've saved sure will. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#HWGuy">Heavy Weapons Guy</a> -
  A walking tank. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The name says it all. A slow moving, heavily armored beast toting an enormous assault
    cannon, the HW Guy can mow down any enemy in seconds. Not a lot of finesse in this one,
    since the cannon spits out so much fire you barely need to aim it. If you like picking a
    defensive position in a map and saying &quot;No-one, and I mean no-one, is getting past
    here&quot;, then the HW Guy's the class you want. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#Pyro">Pyro</a> - Set them on
  fire, and watch them burn. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A great first line of defense, the Pyro can easily knock chunks out of the enemy with
    his flamethrower. He doesn't have much in the way of killing weaponry, but he can make
    sure no-one gets into the base without being set on fire, and being burned alive tends to
    upset people. If you like running into a room, firing wildly, and then watching enemies
    run around screaming as they roast, then the Pyro is perfect for you. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#Spy">Spy</a> - The perfect
  infiltrator and terrorist, all in one. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A class who can disguise himself to look like anyone, the Spy can often walk into the
    enemy base, right past the defenders. Able to kill an enemy in a single hit with his
    knife, the Spy is someone you definitely don't want to turn your back on. After a few of
    their members have been knifed in the back, teams tend to get fairly paranoid. You know
    you're winning when they start to shoot each other for fear they're Spies. If you like
    matching your wits with the enemy instead of your reflexes, then the Spy is your class. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <a HREF="#Engineer">Engineer</a> - The
  perfect remote defender. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When your base needs some heavy defense, the Engineer comes to the rescue, building
    automatic sentry guns that track enemies and kill them. Able to repair his teammates'
    armor and build machines to dispense ammunition, the Engineer is often the core player in
    large defensive squads. If you need to defend your base against all those hardcore players
    out there with much better aim, the Engineer's the perfect class. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>If you've read over TF's player classes and you're still not sure which one to pick,
choose one that suits your experience level. Medics, Soldiers and HW Guys are all good
first-time classes. Once you've got the hang of one or two of them, move on to some more
complex classes, like the Engineer and Spy if you want to avoid a lot of combat, or the
Sniper, Demoman, and Pyro if you like being in the thick of things. </p>

    Hopefully the defenders won't have time to avoid it with only a second's warning. After

  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <b>Become one with your sniper rifle.</b></h6>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The sniper rifle takes awhile to master. The trick to using it is to learn to aim
    effectively. When you press your &quot;Fire&quot; button, you begin to aim. Your rifle
    will raise slightly and a red laser sight will appear where you're aiming. When you
    release the &quot;Fire&quot; button, the rifle fires. <b>The longer you hold down the
    &quot;Fire&quot; button, the more damage the shot does.</b> If you aim for a full 2 to 3
    seconds before you fire the shot, you'll kill almost any class in a single hit. If the
    enemy is a fair distance away, use the zoom capability of the rifle by pressing your
    &quot;Use Special Skill&quot; key (right mouse button by default). </p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <b>Use your sniper rifle like a rifle.</b></h6>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Always remember that the sniper rifle is a rifle, not a pistol or shotgun. You can't
    just shoot from the hip. If you're running, you won't be able to fire the sniper rifle
    until you slow down and take aim. If you need to fire on the run, use your nailgun or auto
    rifle. </p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <b>Aim for the head.</b></h6>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The sniper rifle does more damage if you hit your target in the head. This damage adds
    to the damage created by the amount of time you aimed before firing. You'll kill anyone if
    you aim for a couple of seconds and hit them in the head. Another thing to note is that if
    you shoot them in the legs, you'll slow them down. </p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <b>Avoid letting enemies get close.</b></h6>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You're fairly weak when it comes to close combat, so don't let your enemies reach you.
    Find a position where they can't get to you easily. If they do get near you, don't try to
    kill them with the sniper rifle. Change to your nailgun or auto rifle and gun them down.
    You can try lobbing some grenades at them to keep them away too. </p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <b>Hide your laser sight.</b></h6>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It's a good idea to start aiming before you see your enemies so that you can build up a
    bit of damage before you fire at them. Since your laser sight is visible, learn to hide it
    in places where your enemies can't see it. </p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> <b>Use your auto rifle to finish them
  off.</b></h6>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The auto rifle is a great weapon for finishing off targets who you know are low on
    health. If you hit them with a well-aimed shot from your sniper rifle, it's more than
    likely they'll be low on health, so switch to your auto rifle and pump a few rounds into
    them. They'll have a hard time dodging you. </p>

    time. The rocket will hit the ground at your feet, exploding and propelling you up into
    the air. It'll hurt you a bit, but it's a great way to get into areas of the map that are
    normally inaccessible. It takes a bit of practice, but once you've got it you'll be the
    bane of snipers everywhere as you rocket jump into their sniping positions from the ground
    below. </p>

    <p>Your main weapon is your grenade/pipebomb launcher. It has two modes, grenade and
    pipebomb. In grenade mode it lobs grenades that explode on contact with enemies. If the
    grenades don't hit anything they explode after a couple of seconds. In pipebomb mode, the
    launcher lobs pipebombs. These are simply grenades that don't explode on contact. Instead,
    you remotely detonate them at any time by hitting your &quot;Use Special Skill&quot; key.

    up to is 50 over his normal maximum health. Adrenaline is short-lived, and the player's

    <p>Your assault cannon takes a second to wind up before it begins firing. This means that
    it's not a good idea to guard places where a Scout can appear and get past you before
    you've begun firing. Enclosed spaces are also bad for you because they allow the enemy to
    jump out, lob rockets and grenades at you, and then duck back behind cover before you can
    hit them. That said, large open spaces are also dangerous for you due to your slow speed.
    Snipers and Soldiers can pick you off from a distance, where the inaccurate fire of your
    assault cannon renders it fairly ineffective. Luckily, enemy snipers rarely make it into
    your base. An ideal defensive position for a HW Guy is at one end of a long corridor that
    enemies have to move through, allowing you to fire at them as they approach. </p>

    <p>The strength of a Pyro comes in his ability to set enemies on fire with his
    flamethrower and incendiary cannon. The more you hit your enemies with fire, the longer
    they'll burn and the more damage they'll take. You're a great class for sowing confusion
    in the enemy ranks, mainly because it's really hard to aim effectively when you're burning
    to death. Keep in mind that your weaponry doesn't do a lot of damage though, and it'll
    take quite a while to kill armored classes like the Soldier and HW Guy. Get in close, set
    them on fire, and retreat while they burn. Keep doing it until they die. </p>

<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The flamethrower is your main method of setting enemies on fire, but the incendiary
    cannon has two advantages that make it essential in some situations. First, and most
    obvious, is that it has a far greater range and can ignite multiple targets at once. The
    rockets travel fairly slowly, but have a larger blast radius than the Soldier's rockets.
    They don't do much damage, and they don't set everyone on fire, so they're great for
    lighting up the enemy Snipers and providing the confusion your team needs to get a squad
    across the open areas between bases. Secondly, and most importantly, <b>they ignite
    enemies through walls</b>. The heat generated by the rockets penetrates right through
    walls, floors and ceilings, setting any enemies on the other side alight as well. If the
    enemy Snipers are causing you trouble on 2fort, run under them and fire some shots into
    the ceiling. </p>

    <p>One of the most useful things a Pyro can do is be the first line of Defense for a team.
    Guard the entrance to your base, and make it your mission to set every single enemy who
    passes you on fire. Don't worry too much about killing them, just make sure you ignite
    them a bit. Once they're past you, warn the rest of the team's Defense that there are
    incoming enemies. This early warning, combined with the fact that no attackers reach the
    main Defense without being singed, can often be the thing that prevents the enemy from
    breaking through. </p>

    watching for anyone on their team who's doing anything out of the ordinary. You need to
    watch the enemy so you can become one of them. Pick your disguise carefully, and change it

    <p>Remember that your teammates will also see your disguise. So if you're disguised as an
    enemy Sniper, your teammates will probably think you're an enemy Sniper too. If they're
    smart, they'll read your ID in their status bar and know you're a Spy, but usually,
    they'll pump a few rounds into you. You can help prevent this by sticking to a simple

    pretending to be their buddy for the past 2 minutes. The only exception to this rule is

    <p>Use your ability to feign death a lot. Spys are very effective at killing specific
    individuals on the enemy team, so they are particularly lethal on maps where 1 or 2
    classes are important. For example, in CanalZone 2, Scouts are essential because they're
    needed to carry Flags from their base out to points on the map. Find places where the
    Scouts will be moving past, and lie in wait for them. Be careful not to look around while
    you're &quot;dead&quot;, because the enemy will be able to see your &quot;corpse&quot;
    moving. Wait until they pass you, then stand up and knife them in the back. Another useful

    every 10 seconds, and lets anyone get some from it. It's like a mini Resupply Room. If
    you've got a group of Defenders in a place where they can't get to a Resupply Room quickly

    posts. Dispensers are also great if they're hidden somewhere near the enemy base to allow
    your attack squads to resupply right before they go into the enemy base. Like sentryguns,
    you can only have one dispenser built at a time, so place it wisely. They have little
    health, so keep your dispenser fully repaired if you can. Hit it with your wrench to bring
    up the Maintenance menu, just as you do for the sentrygun. </p>
  </ul>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> Repair your teammates' armor.</h6>
  <ul>
    <p>Another important and often overlooked trait of the Engineer is his ability to repair
    his teammates' armor. Simply hit your teammates with your wrench. You'll need a bit of
    metal to repair them, but not much. Keep hitting them until their armor's fully repaired,
    or until you've run out of metal. Note that your teammates will probably use the
    &quot;Call for a Medic!&quot; command to ask you to repair their armor, so if you hear
    them yell for help, look around. The player who called for help will have a floating red
    cross above his head. </p>
  </ul>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> Make ammunition for your teammates.</h6>
  <ul>
    <p>The other useful thing an Engineer can do is make ammunition. This is great for swiftly
    delivering ammunition to Defenders, like HW Guys, who don't have time to get to the
    Resupply Room and back to their posts before the enemy attacks. Making ammunition is easy.
    Simply select <i>Command Menu/Discard Ammunition</i>. Unlike every other class, who only
    drop the ammunition they're carrying that they can't use, Engineers always drop some
    ammunition of each type, using their metal supply to fabricate ammunition that they don't
    have. If you don't have much metal, you won't be able to make much, but its probably still
    a better idea than sending that HW Guy back to the Resupply Room. </p>
  </ul>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> Protect your Sentrygun with EMP
  grenades.</h6>
  <ul>
    <p>Your EMP grenades are tricky. They explode like any grenade, but instead of doing any
    damage themselves, they detonate anything explosive around them and rely on that to do
    damage instead. This means players with explosive ammunition, like rockets and shells,
    will explode like firecrackers. Detpacks will go boom. Pipebombs will detonate. Ammo packs
    will go up in smoke. Roughly speaking, the more ammunition lying around, the more
    dangerous the EMP blast is going to be, and some classes, like the Soldier and HW Guy, are
    carrying a heckuvva lotta ammunition. The only downside is that some classes, like the
    Scout, are carrying almost no explosive ammunition at all, and can simply walk right
    through an EMP blast. Use your EMP grenades, combined with your hand grenades, to destroy
    enemies who are trying to destroy your sentrygun. Your sentrygun is far more dangerous to
    them than you are, so if you're lucky, you'll be able to throw a grenade at their feet
    while they're otherwise occupied. </p>

<h3>What are some of the things I can do?</h3>
</a>

<P>
<H4><A name="throwgren">Throw Grenades</A></H4>
Each class in TF has one or two types of grenade. Grenades are extremely important to becoming a good TFC
player, so learn to use them well. Some kill, some wound, some confuse, some cover your retreat, and they all
make you more effective at your chosen class when used wisely.
You have two grenade throwing keys, one for each type of grenade your class has. When you push down the
grenade key, you'll pull the pin out of the grenade. This is called Priming. When you release the grenade key, you'll
throw the grenade. Note that the grenade will explode 3 seconds after you've Primed the grenade, even if you 
haven't thrown it yet. Your two grenade keys are &quot;Throw First Grenade Type&quot; (F by default) and
&quot;Throw Second Grenade Type&quot; (G by default).
<p>
Here's a breakdown of the grenades used by each class:

<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you simply hit one of your grenade keys, you'll Prime and throw the grenade immediately. This gives enemies
	a good three seconds to get clear of the grenade, which is usually enough time for them to make it to safety. To
	prevent this, press and hold your grenade key for a couple of seconds, and then release it. The grenade will go off
	a second later, which shouldn't give them enough time to react.
  </blockquote>
</ul>



<p><br>
<br>
<H4><A name="saveme">Call for a Medic!</A></H4>
Medics on your team are incredibly useful, being the only things that can heal you when you're in the middle of
enemy territory, or when you're defending a position that's too dangerous to leave. Medics are usually busy
healing other teammembers or killing enemies, so TF provides you with an easy way to attract their attention.
Select <i>Command Menu/Call for Medic</i>, and you'll hear yourself yell for a Medic. In addition,
any Medics on your team will see a flashing red cross above your head, so they can easily pinpoint the player
calling them, even if he's in the middle of a crowd of defenders.


<p><br>
<br>
<H4><A name="flaginfo">Find out where my Flag is</A></H4>
Many TF maps are based around the movement of Flags, usually in the form of a Capture the Flag scoring
system. You can find out the rough status of the Flags by hitting your &quot;Display Flag Status&quot; key
(I by default). This will display a message in the top left of your screen. For each Flag, it'll tell you whether it's
in it's Base or lying somewhere around the map, and who's carrying it if it's being carried.


<p><br>
<br>
<H4><A name="discard">Discard Ammunition for my Teammates</A></H4>
One extremely useful and very under-used action that you can do is <i>Command Menu/Discard Ammunition</i>;
(or the X key by default). When selected, you'll drop a backpack in front of you containing all the ammunition you're carrying
that you don't need. For instance, if you're a Medic, you have no way of using Rockets, but you might have picked
some up from a fallen enemy's backpack or from a resupply station. So next time you see a teammate, try dropping
<p><img SRC="tips.jpg" width="51" height="19"> </p>
<blockquote>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> Discard ammunition for Defenders.</h6>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Players defending a position are only effective while they're at their post. If they have to run off to the nearest
	Resupply Room to get more ammunition, they're leaving their position undefended. You can help them out by discarding
	any unused ammunition you have whenever you run past them. Every second they can spend at their post and not
	resupplying is another second the enemy won't be able to get into your base.
  </blockquote>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <h6><img SRC="bullet.gif" WIDTH="10" height="13"> Leave unused ammunition for others.</h6>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Resupply Rooms contain ammunition for every class and weapon, but no classes actually use all four types of 
	ammunition. It's a good practice to always discard your unused ammunition as you exit the Resupply Room, leaving
	anything you didn't need to the next player, who might need it.
  </blockquote>
</ul>


<p><br>
<br>
<H4><A name="dropitems">Pass the Flag to a Teammate</A></H4>
If you're a slow moving class, or you're nearly dead, it's not a good idea to be carrying the enemy Flag. If you see a member
of your team nearby that's faster or healthier, its a good idea to throw the Flag to him/her. You can do this by hitting your
 &quot;Drop Flag&quot; key (C by default). This will throw the Flag out in front of you.
