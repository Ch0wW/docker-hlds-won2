-Gooseman for being awesome. (shameless ass-kiss)
-Hunt Interactive for funding out gaming addiction!
-Junko for the hotsheep painting.
-All HOTSHEEP for the ideas, testing, and "sheep love".
-TheContinuum and [BoD]archer for setting up the playtest.

-Genalin for her nifty ideas and enthusiasm.
-All the awesome feedback from others.
