Background: a sprawling neo-romanesque
palace known as Villa Piranesi is to be
opened to the public as a museum. 
Restored furniture and works of art are 
being shipped into the compound.

Terrorists: Prevent the museum from
opening by destroying one of its two 
main attractions; the antique sundial
in the front courtyard or the grand
celestial orrery in the back garden.

Counter-Terrorists:  Protect the
historical site against the terrorists.
