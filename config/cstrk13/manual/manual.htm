        Counter-Strike is a modification (MOD) to Valve
        Software’s hit game Half-Life. It modifies the multiplayer aspects of
        Half-Life to provide the player with an experience that a trained
        counter-terrorist unit or terrorist unit might have. Players will join
        either a terrorist or a counter-terrorist force and play in one of the
        four types of scenarios. These are:
        <ul>
          <li>
             <b>Hostage Rescue</b>, where the counter-terrorists must
            rescue hostages.
          <li>
             <b>Bomb / Defuse</b>, where terrorists must plant a bomb in
            a critical area and counter-terrorists must defuse the bomb.</li>
          <li>
             <b>Escape</b>, where the terrorists must escape
            from the counter-terrorists.</li>
          <li>
             <b>Assassination</b>, Where the VIP must be
            escorted by the counter-terrorists to an escape point.</li>
        </ul>
         Weapons and other pieces of equipment are available at a
        cost, and players can earn money in a variety of different ways while
        playing the game. Players may also lose money for inappropriate actions.
        E.g. killing a hostage or a teammate.

        <b>Getting Started</b></a>
        <hr width="20%" align="left" noshade size="1" color="#11242d">
           After installing Counter-Strike, you will want to
          activate it through the Half-Life menu. To do this, choose ‘custom
          game’ from the initial Half-Life menu, then select Counter-Strike
          from the list that appears. Choose ‘activate’ and you should
          notice that the appearance of the menus has changed.
           The next thing you will want to do is familiarize
          yourself with the mapping of the game <a href="#Controls"><b>controls</b></a>
          on your keyboard/mouse. Choose ‘configuration-&gt;<a href="#Controls"><b>controls</b></a>’
          and look over the default keyboard configuration. To change any of the
          default mappings, double-click on the key/button field in the window.
          You will then be able to enter your desired key for that function. (A
          warning; if the new key/button was previously mapped to another
          function, you will need to select a new key for that function, as it
          will no longer have a key mapping).
           If you have no previous experience with Half-Life,
          it is strongly recommended that you play the excellent tutorial
          included with that game. See the ‘<a href="#Controls"><b>Controls</b></a>’
          section below for a description of what each game <a href="#Controls"><b>control</b></a>
          does.</p>

        <b>The Scenarios</b></a>
        <hr width="20%" align="left" noshade size="1" color="#11242d">
           <b>Hostage Rescue</b><br>
          As a terrorist, your role in a hostage rescue level is to prevent
          counter-terrorists (CTs) from leading the hostages from where they are
          being held to the hostage rescue zone. Terrorists win hostage rescue
          rounds by eliminating the counter-terrorist force while preventing
          them from rescuing hostages.
           CTs win a round by finding the hostages and
          leading more than half of them to freedom. CTs can get the attention
          of a hostage by moving near him then pressing their ‘Use’ key (see
          <a href="#Controls"><b>Controls</b></a>, Use). The hostage will now
          follow the CT back to the rescue zone. If a CT wants the hostage to
          stop following, they need to press ‘Use’ again and the hostage
          will stay put. Sometimes when you have a group of hostages following
          you, they may block you into an area; you can push them out of the way
          by simply walking into them. CTs can also win a round by eliminating
          the terrorists.
		  <p>
           <b>Bomb/Defuse</b><br>
          In a bomb/defuse map, the goal of the terrorist is to plant a C4 bomb
          in the designated area then prevent the CTs from defusing the bomb.
          Players must remember to stay well clear of the bomb when it explodes,
          as it has a large and deadly blast radius. The bomb is randomly
          assigned to a terrorist at the start of the round. Team members can
          identify the bomb carrier by the backpack they are wearing and the
          player with the bomb will see an icon on their Heads Up Display (see <a href="#HUD"><b>HUD</b></a>,
          bomb carrier). To plant the bomb, the carrier must be in the vicinity
          of the bombing target. While having the bomb as their currently
          selected item, the player must then press and hold their fire key (see
          <a href="#Controls"><b>Controls</b></a>, Fire) for three seconds for
          the bomb to be planted. The bomb will go off after a set period of
          time has passed (45 seconds by default). The level is won by the
          terrorists when the bomb explodes (maximum payoff) or if the CT team
          is eliminated (smaller payoff).
           CTs can win a defuse map in two ways: by defusing
          the bomb or by eliminating the Terrorists (if the Terrorists managed
          to plant the bomb before being eliminated, CTs must still defuse the
          bomb to win the round). To defuse the bomb, CTs must stand near the
          bomb, target it then press and hold their ‘use’ key until the bomb
          is defused. Buying a defuse kit will halve the time required to defuse
          a bomb.</p>
         <b>Escape<br>
        </b>The terrorist team starts out in a fortified location and must "escape" to one of the pre-defined escape points. The CT's must exterminate
        them before they can escape. The Terrorists win the round once 50% of the team has
        successfully escaped. They can also break into the armory to steal weapons,
        or just get out of there. The two teams will switch roles after every 8 rounds of play.
        Both sides can also win the scenario if they manage to wipe the
        opposition team out.</p>
           <b>Assassination</b><br>
          One member of the CT team will serve as the VIP. The object is to get the VIP safely to the pre-defined escape points. If he
          dies, the CT's lose the round. If he makes it safely, the CT's win.
          The VIP has a unique skin, only carries a knife and pistol, and has ample body armor.&nbsp;</p>
         The terrorist job is to assassinate the VIP, but
        with the other CT's guarding the VIP it is never an easy task.</p>
            Certain weapons cannot be purchased by each team in this gameplay
          scenario, and these will be grayed out on the weapon selection screen.</p>

        weapons. Each round of Counter-Strike lasts for five minutes. If neither

          - <b>Bomb / Defuse</b>: If the round ends, with the bomb having not
          blown up a target, and there is still at least 1 player left on both
          sides the CT's will win.&nbsp;<br>
          - <b>Escape</b>: If the round ends, with at least 1 player alive on
          both teams, and less than 50% of the terrorists have escape, the CT's
          will win.<br>
          - <b>Assassination</b>: If the round ends, with players left on both
          teams and the VIP has not reached the escape point, the terrorists
          win.&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
         When a player is killed during a round they will
        enter an observer mode until the next round. While in observer mode,
        they can fly around the level and watch the action. There are three
        types of observer modes. The first is ghost mode, where the player can
        freely fly around the level unobstructed by anything. The second is
        locked chasecam. While in locked chasecam you will be locked behind the
        player you are observing. The third is freelook chasecam, in this mode
        you can freely swing the camera around the player you are observing.
        While in the observer modes you can use the jump key (see <a href="#Controls"><b>Controls</b></a>,
        Jump) to switch between the three modes and the fire button (see <a href="#Controls"><b>Controls</b></a>,
        Fire) to switch from one player to the next. If a player joins into a
        game when a round is already in progress, they will be immediately
        placed into observer mode until the current round ends.

         <b>Sound, Pros and Cons</b><br>
        Stealth is vitally important in Counter-Strike. When a player runs at
        full tilt (which is the default), their footsteps can be heard. To
        prevent this, use the walk key (see <a href="#Controls"><b>Controls</b></a>,
        Walk) when trying to avoid detection. Also be wary of doors, ladders and
        elevators. These will often emit a sound that may give you or your
        enemies position away.
		<p>
         <b>Life is Precious</b><br>
        Counter-Strike strives for realism. Running into a firefight all gung-ho
        will generally get you killed. The player can only sustain a few bullet
        shots before dying, depending on the type of gun (ammunition actually)
        being shot with, and the condition and presence of kevlar. There are
        also one hit kills in CS. Most guns can kill a player in one shot if
        they connect with the head. Savvy CS players, will take cover as often
        as possible and use their surroundings to their advantage. Working with
        your teammates to bring the enemy down is encouraged and necessary to
        beat the other team. Keep in mind, you only get one life per round in
        CS. If you die, you will be put into Observer mode until the round is
        over.
		<p>
         <b>Know Your Gun</b><br>
        Counter-Strike has realistically modeled weaponry. If you run and fire
        at the same time, your accuracy will be horrible (changes with different
        guns), Standing still increases accuracy and crouching is even better.
        Also be aware of the guns recoil, holding down the trigger isn’t as
        effective as short quick bursts. It is also important to know that all
        the rifles can shoot through walls to some extent. The Para Machine Gun,
        and the Desert Eagle Pistol can as well.</p>
         <b>Map Voting System </b>(New to beta6.5)<br>
        There is now a way for players to vote for maps. Players can type 'listmaps' to see the maps available to vote on, and then they type
        'votemap X'      where X is the corresponding number of the map. Only
        after a certain number of players have voted for the map which one
        player has started a vote on, will the sever change map.</p>
        <blockquote>
         <i>Note: Server admins who want to add new maps must also
        add an entry into mapcycle.txt,  that allows players to vote on any new maps.</i></p>
