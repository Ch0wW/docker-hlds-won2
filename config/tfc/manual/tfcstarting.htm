<A NAME="whatis"><H3>What is Team Fortress 1.5?</H3></A>
<P>
Team Fortress 1.5 (TF) is Valve's new add-on for Half-Life that combines the thrilling first-person multiplayer gameplay 
of the original Team Fortress with Half-Life's leading edge technology.  In Team Fortress 1.5, you play one of nine roles 
or classes, such as <A HREF="TFCclasses.htm#Medic">Medic</A>, 
<A HREF="TFCclasses.htm#Soldier">Soldier</A>, or <A HREF="TFCclasses.htm#Engineer">Engineer</A>, and then join your teammates online or over a LAN to battle against enemy teams. 
Each class has unique weapons, items, abilities, and style of play.
<P>
Team Fortress 1.5 brings the social multiplayer gaming experience to new heights. The varying strengths and playing styles 
of each class and the different objectives for each map encourage you and your teammates to work together and add a level of strategy and interaction to TFC that you don't find in other first-person multiplayer action games. 
<P>
Team Fortress 1.5 is based on the original Team Fortress mod that took the action gaming community by storm in 1996. TF's features include:
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="bullet.gif" > New sounds and weapons<BR>
	<IMG SRC="bullet.gif" > Enhanced graphics<BR>
	<IMG SRC="bullet.gif" > New models for classes and weapons<BR>

<TD>Keep an eye out for signs saying "Resupply". These designate entrances to rooms where you can restock your armor and ammunition, and heal yourself with healthpaks.

<TD>The map you're currently running around in is called "2fort", and it uses a scoring system called "Capture The Flag". Each Team has a Flag in their Base. Teams must enter the enemy Base, grab the enemy Flag, and bring it back to their Base, where they capture it. After the Flag is captured, it returns to its resting place in the enemy Base. Teams earn 10 points each time they capture the enemy Flag.</TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>

<UL>
<TABLE BORDER = 0>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD>Just as in football, each TFC team needs offensive and defensive players. The players on Offense need to fight their way into the enemy base, grab the Flag, and bring it back to their Base.  The players on Defense need to prevent the enemies from getting their Flag.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD>Remember, you're a Heavy Weapons Guy (HWGuy) in this game, so you're much better at Defense than Offense. This is because you move so slowly that by the time you've made it to the enemy Base, you'll probably have been hit by a lot of enemy fire. Since the enemy Base is laid out in the same manner as your Base, being on Defense allows you to familiarize yourself with your Base's layout before running into the enemy's Base where the chances of being killed are much greater.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD>A key part of defending is finding the right place to defend. You want to find bottlenecks that enemies are forced to come through, where you'll be able to fire at them from a superior position. </TD>
	<P>
	<TABLE><TR>
		<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="tip.jpg"></TD> 
		<TD><H5>If you've never seen a map before, it's a good idea to seek out groups of your teammates on Defense. They've probably played the map before, so they'll be in a good place to defend.</H5>

<A NAME="firstgame_9"><H4>Defending the Ramp Room</H4></A>
<UL>
<TABLE BORDER = 0>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD>The best place for a HWGuy (that's you!) to defend a 2fort Base is in the Ramp Room. This is the main bottleneck that enemies need to move through to get to the basement, which is where your flag is located. So, make your way to the Ramp Room. You'll see signs situated around your base that'll lead you to it. It's a big room with two levels, with two ramps leading from the lower level to the upper level. Once you've found it, walk to the upper level and get into a position where you can fire at enemies trying to make their way up either of the two ramps.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD>Make sure you've got your Assault Cannon ready. It's the big gun that fires a lot of bullets really fast. The drawback to this weapon is that it takes a second or so to wind up before it begins to fire, and while you're firing it you move even more slowly. Luckily, you're probably more heavily armored than any enemies who come into your base, so you can take a few hits while you shower them with bullets.</TD>

</TABLE>
	<P>
	<TABLE><TR>
		<TD VALIGN=TOP> <IMG SRC="tip.jpg"></TD>

	<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
	<TD>Wait at the top of the Ramp Room and kill any enemies who try to get past you. Don't bother chasing them if they do get past because they'll all be faster than you, and hopefully, someone else on your team is down in the basement defending it. </TD>

<A NAME="firstgame_10"><H4>Working with Your Teammates</H4></A>
TF is all about working with other players as a Team. Doing this effectively isn't too hard if you make use of the tools built in to TFC. 
There are a variety of them, so here's a quick look at some of the most useful ones.
<UL>
<TABLE BORDER = 0>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD><B>You can send a message to your teammates with the "Team Message" key</B> (U by default). This is the standard method of communicating with your teammates. It's great for talking, but there are better ways of sending specific information. For example:</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD><B>You can send a quick message to your teammates with the Command Menu. Selecting this brings up commonly used messages as well as ones keyed specifically to the map you are playing.</B>  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD><B>Don't forget to call for a Medic using the Command Menu</B> (hit Shift to bring up the Command Menu Interface and select "Call for Medic") if you're low on health and you see a Medic on your team nearby. Medics can even provide you 
with adrenalin boosts that will actually take you over the maximum health of your class for a short time.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD><B>Keep an eye on your teammates' health and armor</B>. Simply point your crosshair at your teammate, and you'll see a readout in the bottom left corner of your screen that displays their
name, health, and armor. If they're defending with you, tell them you'll defend the Ramp Room while they quickly go and resupply. Make sure there's always at least one 
defender left in the Ramp Room!</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD><B>Avoid picking up ammunition you don't need when resupplying</B>. As a HWGuy, you don't use rockets, so don't pick them up (your teammates will need them!). If you do 
pick some up by accident, or get some rockets from a fallen enemy, you can give them to your teammates by selecting Command Menu/Discard Unused Ammunition. 
This will cause you to drop a backpack containing all the ammunition you're carrying that you don't need. Your teammates will be thrilled!</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD><B>Read any team messages you receive from other teammates</B>. You'll see them in the bottom left of your screen, prefaced by (TEAM). They'll warn you of incoming 
enemies, tell you if the enemy has broken through Defense, and so on. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</UL>

<A NAME="firstgame_11"><H4>Game Over</H4></A>
At some point the game will end, and you'll be shown the game scores. You'll recognize them as the same scores shown when you hit your "Show Scores" key ("Tab" by default) earlier. 
Players are sorted by their Teams, and for each player you'll be able to see how many times they died and how many enemies they killed. This isn't terribly important in 
TF, since some classes aren't designed to kill people (like the Scout!) but are just as essential to a Team's success as a Soldier or HWGuy.
<P>
You'll be able to see the score of each Team to the right of the Team name. This score is based on how well each Team achieved the map objective, which was to 
capture the enemy flag. Killing the enemy 1000 times won't win you the map, but a single Capture might!
<P>
You'll be shown the scores for awhile, and then the server will move on to the next map. Depending on how the server's set up, it could be 2fort again or it might be a 
new map. This time, try experimenting with some of the other classes and see what strikes your fancy. 
<P>
You can change your class at any time by selecting "Change Class" in the Command Menu Interface. It'll bring up the Class menu again, allowing you to pick your new class 
The next time you respawn, you'll be that class. Keep in mind that when you change classes this way, you will die immediately and respawn.

<H4>What is the Command Menu Interface?</H4>
<UL>
<TABLE BORDER = 0>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="bullet.gif"></TD>
<TD>The Command Menu is an in-game menu system that lets you quickly and easily use a variety of commands without having to remember more than one key. By default, you can bring up the CMI by either holding the "shift" key, or by tapping it once to open it and a second time to close it. Once the menu is open, use it just as you would the Windows Start Menu. Left clicking on any menu item executes the appropriate command. Hitting the escape key always exits the Command Menu.</TD>
